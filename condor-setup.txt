Basically, the lstm-sctipt.sh creates .condor files for each benchmark,
as well as an executable script that runs the lstm, and redirects its
output to Zhan's scratch directory.

**If you want to run it, you need to be ssh'd into streetpizza

The .condor files in here (lstm.condor, lstm-gpu.condor) are basic
templates used by the script.

GPU stuff:
    -need tensorflow-gpu==1.5.1 (bc cluster GPUs use CUDA 8.0)
        * pip3 install tensorflow-gpu==1.5.1
    -need cudNN 6.0 AND 5.0 (bc cluster GPUs don't have)
        * I've copied these to cancer; to set it up for your account,
          you just have to copy them to your home directory
